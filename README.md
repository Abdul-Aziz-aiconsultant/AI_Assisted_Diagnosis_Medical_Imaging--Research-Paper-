**Abstract:**  
Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers globally, and early diagnosis significantly improves patient outcomes.  
This paper explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ‚Äî ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 ‚Äî on the HAM10000 dataset for skin lesion classification.  
EfficientNetB0 achieved **87.2% accuracy**, balancing performance and efficiency. The study highlights deep learning's role in improving diagnostic accessibility, especially in low-resource healthcare settings.
